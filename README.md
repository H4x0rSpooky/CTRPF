## Description
**Blank - CTRPluginFramework**

This is my personal blank source code for CTRPF.

## Installation
> You need a PC with 64-Bit Support!

* `Install Python` - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* `Install DevkitPro` - [Download](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases)
Once DevkitPro is installed run these commands in the Command Prompt: `pacman -Syuw 3ds-dev` and `pacman -Syuw 3ds-portlibs`

After everything is setup and installed properly, download the Source Code and run the `build.bat` to compile the 3gx Plugin.
