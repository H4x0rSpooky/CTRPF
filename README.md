## Description
**Blank CTRPluginFramework Source**

This is my personal blank source code for CTRPF.

## Installation
> You need a PC with 64-Bit Support!

* `Install Python` - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* `Install DevkitPro` - [Download](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases)

Once `DevkitPro` is installed run these commands in the command prompt: `pacman -Syuw 3ds-dev` and `pacman -Syuw 3ds-portlibs`.

After everything is setup and installed properly, download the `libctrpf.zip`. Find the `devkitPro` folder (usually in `C:\devKitPro`), make a folder called `libctrpf` in it and place the zip's content into it. Then download the source code of the blank CTRPF and run the `build.bat` to compile the 3gx plugin.
