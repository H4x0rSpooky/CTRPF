## Description
**CTRPluginFramework Guide**

This is a guide for CTRPF creations.

## Installation
> You need a PC with 64-Bit Support!

`Install Python` - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

`Install DevkitPro` - [Download](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases)

Once `DevkitPro` is installed run these commands in the command prompt:
* `pacman -Syuw 3ds-dev`
* `pacman -Syuw 3ds-portlibs`

After everything is setup and installed properly, download the `libctrpf.zip`. Locate the `devkitPro` folder (usually in `C:\devKitPro`), make a folder called `libctrpf` in it and place the zip's content into it. Then download the [source code of the blank CTRPF](https://github.com/mariohackandglitch/CTRPluginFramework-BlankTemplate) and run the `Makefile` to compile the 3gx plugin. You are now free to modify the `cheats.cpp` and `main.cpp` as you like. If you have any questions regarding code and other CTRPF related questions, feel free to join [Nanquitas' Discord Server](https://discord.gg/z4ZMh27).
